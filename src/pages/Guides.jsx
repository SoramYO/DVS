        All these 4 qualities affect the look and pricing of your stone and must be considered when selecting your loose certified diamond.
      </h1>
      <h2>1.Cut</h2>
      <p>
        This characteristic determines the brilliance or shine of your diamond. A diamond wrongly cut will look dull and unattractive.
      </p>
      <h2>2.Colour</h2>
      <p>
        The color of a diamonds represents the amount of color present in the diamond. Colorless diamonds are graded with a D, the more tints of yellow color present in a diamond the higher the grading will be. Colourless or white diamonds are the most precious ones.
      </p>
      <h2>3.Carat</h2>
      <p>
        The weight of a diamond is represented by carat (one carat equals 0.2 gram).
      </p>
      <h2>4.Clarity</h2>
      <p>
        The number of impurities (clouds, feathers,...) that are present in a diamond is measured with the clarity scale. Going from Flawless up to included (IF/F - I).
