      <h1>The 4 C’s of Diamonds: Evaluating Diamond Quality</h1>
      <p>
        The 4 Cs – cut, color, clarity, and carat – are the widely accepted standard characteristics for a diamond that determine its quality and <a href="https://www.diamonds.pro/education/diamond-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">value</a>. While each ‘C’ plays a role, cut is the most important in determining a diamond's brilliance and sparkle. Finding the perfect harmony between these 4 Cs will help you balance beauty and value when looking for a diamond.

          <h2>Carat</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Carat refers to the diamond’s weight, such as a <a href="https://www.diamonds.pro/education/2-carat-diamond-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 carat</a> or <a href="https://www.diamonds.pro/education/3-carat-diamond-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 carat diamond</a>.</li>
            <li>Carat weight can be important to some, but a diamond of any carat weight can be extraordinary.</li>
            <li>It’s more critical that your diamond is well-cut.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div className="frame">
          <h2>Color</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A diamond can be colorless to the naked eye, or have some tint to it.</li>
            <li>It’s best to find a diamond that appears white once mounted in a setting.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.diamonds.pro/education/color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diamond color</a> ranges from D to Z, but there is no need to overpay for a D color diamond.</li>
            <li>An H or I color diamond, depending on the setting, will look just as clear and white as a colorless grade diamond.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div className="frame">
          <h2>Clarity</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Almost all diamonds have imperfections.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://www.diamonds.pro/education/clarity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diamond's clarity</a> refers to how many blemishes and inclusions the diamond has, along with how noticeable they are.</li>
            <li>Above all, opt for a diamond that's eye-clean, meaning you can't see imperfections unless you put it under magnification.</li>
            <li>In our <a href="https://www.diamonds.pro/education/eye-clean-diamonds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eye-clean diamond article</a> we show you which inclusions, not grades, to look out for.</li>

        <div className="frame">
          <h2>Cut</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Often confused with <a href="https://www.diamonds.pro/education/shapes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diamond shape</a>, cut refers to <a href="https://www.diamonds.pro/education/shapes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how well a diamond is cut</a> and polished.</li>
            <li>Cut is the biggest factor that plays into how brilliant and beautiful a diamond is.</li>

      <h2>What are the 4 C's of diamonds?</h2>
      <p>
        The 4 Cs of diamonds—Carat, Cut, Color, and Clarity—are key factors that determine a diamond's beauty and quality. These characteristics interact to influence how the diamond looks and performs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cut</strong>: Determines how well the diamond reflects light.</li>
        <li><strong>Color</strong>: Measures the absence of color; less color equals higher value.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Indicates the presence of imperfections; fewer flaws mean higher quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Carat</strong>: Refers to the diamond's size.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These qualities are graded consistently by experts, helping you assess a diamond's value. Understanding the 4 Cs lets you choose a high-quality diamond that meets your preferences.

      <h2>The Characteristics of Diamonds</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.diamonds.pro/education/gia-diamonds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GIA</a> (Gemological Institute of America) is a leading authority with an advanced system for grading diamond characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        We <span style={{ color: "red" }}>highly recommend</span> obtaining a diamond certificate from GIA due to its consistency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the 4 Cs is graded on a scale to assess quality. While universal terms and standards are used, grading can differ between various <a href="https://www.diamonds.pro/education/diamond-certification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lab.</a>

        Here is a video where a professional jeweler walks you through the essential factors to consider, including the 4 Cs of diamonds—Carat, Cut, Color, and Clarity.

      <p>
        The 4 Cs' grading are key in determining a diamond's value and quality, and sellers often set prices based on these reports. Understanding these basics helps when comparing similar diamonds, but the most important factor is how the diamond looks to the naked eye and its overall appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, <span style={{ color: "red" }}>having a fundamental knowledge of the 4 Cs is crucial for buyers</span>, ensuring you don't overspend on aspects that might not be noticeable.

      <h2>Diamond Quality</h2>
      <p>
        The 4 Cs of diamonds provide an objective method to measure and evaluate diamond quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without these standards, determining diamond quality would be difficult, allowing dishonest vendors to overcharge.
      </p>
      <p>
        An objective guide helps identify high or low-quality diamonds more easily. Each of the 4 Cs gives a measurable description of quality, making it simpler to assess if a diamond is worth its price.
